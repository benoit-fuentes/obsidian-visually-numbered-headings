## Fixes and improvements

### 🐞 Bug Fix: Incorrect heading levels during PDF export

**Problem**

The original implementation generated numbering using the **level of the last heading** for all headings, caused incorrect numbering during **PDF export**, where the rendered DOM structure differs from preview mode.

**Fix**

Each heading now uses its **own level** when generating numbers. Additionally, during PDF export, inline page titles are skipped to avoid numbering unintended headings, This resolves incorrect numbering such as `0.x`, skipped levels, and mismatched hierarchy in exported PDFs.

### ✨ New Feature: Frontmatter-based heading numbering toggle

A new standalone listener, **`VNumHeadingsListener`**, has been introduced to monitor changes to the `vnumheadings` frontmatter field.

* Listens for metadata changes in the active file
* Enables or disables heading numbering in real time，Heading numbering can be toggled using the frontmatter property: vnumheadings. Setting vnumheadings: 1 enables numbering, while omitting the property or setting it to 0 disables it.
* Triggers a preview re-render when the value changes
* Enable heading numbering by default unless vnumheadings is set to 0, If the vnumheadings option is not set, numbering will still be applied. Numbering is disabled only when vnumheadings is explicitly set to 0.

This allows users to control heading numbering **per document**, without reloading or reopening the file.

### ✨ New Feature: PDF Export Heading Styles

During PDF export, the document title is rendered centered, and its color follows the theme CSS variable
`--inline-title-color by default`.

To allow further customization, two optional CSS snippets are provided:

`Snippets-pdf-heading-color.css`
Customize the colors of different heading levels (H1–H6) in exported PDFs.

`Snippets-pdf-title-color.css`
Customize the document title color specifically for PDF export.

These snippets are not enabled automatically.
Users need to manually enable them in Obsidian → Appearance → CSS Snippets.

If these snippets are not enabled, all title and heading colors in the exported PDF will continue to follow the active theme’s color configuration.
